## React State Management: A Comparison through Mini Apps

This repository showcases different approaches to state management in React applications through a collection of small-scale apps:

**State Management Techniques:**

- **React Query:** A library for efficient data fetching and caching, demonstrated in the Anecdotes App (Query Version).
- **Redux:** A popular state management library used in the Anecdotes App (Redux Version) and the Unicafe App.

**Applications:**

- **Anecdotes App (Query Version):** This app manages an anecdote list using React Query for data fetching and caching.
- **Anecdotes App (Redux Version):** This app manages an anecdote list using Redux for centralized state management.
- **Unicafe App:** This app builds a simple cafe menu and ordering system with Redux for state management.

**Comparing Approaches:**

Explore these apps to compare and contrast how each state management strategy handles data and updates within a React application.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-state-management-apps.git`
2. Navigate to the specific app directory you want to explore:
   - `cd query-anecdotes` for the Anecdotes App (Query Version)
   - `cd redux-anecdotes` for the Anecdotes App (Redux Version)
   - `cd unicafe-redux` for the Unicafe App
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm start`

**Explore the Code:**

Each app directory contains its own codebase for handling UI components, state management logic, and data interactions. Examine the code to understand how each approach implements data management functionalities.
